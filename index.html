				<h1>
				Tiny Retreat
				</h1>
				<p>
				Tiny Retreat was a group project I did in University in 2019. It was a project to design and develop a website about Tiny Houses 
				<br><br>
				Tiny Houses is a new archtectural building style as well as a life-style. The idea is to live ecologly in a small living space that is as self-relient as it can be. Tiny houses are mostly build from recycled materials and are build in groups in green areas. So the people interestend in them are enviromentaly minded and want a home that is more in tune with nature.
				<br><br>
				Our idea was to make the website look professional and sleek and the theme were retreats. The fonts were “Comfortaa” for headings as well as the logo and “Avenir Light” for the content. Both these fonts are very thin and look light and are pleasant to look at in addition to looking professional. The color we choose was light desaturated green color that fells more relaxing and fits well with photos we used on the website. Over all the website captures well the feeling of walking in nature which is the type of experience we believed would suit our audience best.
				<br><br>
				I have worked on the layout of the website, from basic wireframes to high fidelity ones and the logo.

				Way Finder
				</h1>
				<p>
				Way Finder was a group project I did in University in 2020. It was a project to create a phone app that would work as a digital map for the University Campuses.
				<br><br>
				The app was ment to work an equivalent to google maps for the students, but would also have addtional info about on-going contstructions as well as more detail information about buildings. The prototype that was developed was only for Hanze University but it was build in a way were other universities could have apps for their own campuses made with out developing that app from ground up. 
				<br><br>
				I have made the layout of the UI, logo and some promotianal materials. The font for the app and all the promotianl items is Caviar Dreams Regular. Its a thin and elegant font that suits the app made for universities well. The UI colors were meant to change based on colors of university for which the app was developed. Two posters as a basic advertisments for the apps as well as some example logos for several other universities.

				Lepanto o Ultimo Cangaceiro
				</h1>
				<p>
				Lepanto is a movie by Caucaso Factory from 2016. I have worked for a month as an assistant graphic designer for them as my internship in 2017.
				<br><br>
				Majority of my time working for Caucaso Factory was spend on making the Press Kit for the movie.<br> I recived all the text that needed to be in it and was taksed with making it look presentable. The presskit was in Italian as well so for me, who doesnt speak it, it made that task a little bit more dificult. Other then that I have made a few posters for the movie and I have worked on a English version of the Lepanto website. The posters were to be digital only so i was free to use thiner fonts then for print.  
				<br><br>
				This was one of my first longer porjects. Beofore that majority of my work was disjointed pieces of design, like posters, logos ect. This was first project for which I made multiple pieces

				Fan Art
				</h1>
				<p>
				This is a collection of my less profesional works. Im a fan of a Twitch streamer by the name Ben Wheeler. Its a joke for his audince to photoshop his face on art of cards from a game he plays often. <br>I decided to participate in this joke and I found this to be a very good exercise for photoshop learning.
				<br><br>
				The inherent chalange in this pieces is to try to match texture. Photos don't blend well with paintings so to make a piece that look well requires a lot of playing with filters. On top of that I have a only a few good quality photos of the streamer so sometimes lighting is not good and it reqires me to get creative with matching that. I worked on a lot of typical projects in graphic design so I find this less orthodox work to be refreshing and it keeps my skills sharp. There is no uniform solution to those as there is to many things in normal projects.
